* A compatible Linux host. The Kubernetes project provides generic instructions for Linux distributions
  based on Debian and Red Hat, and those distributions without a package manager.
* 2 GB or more of RAM per machine (any less will leave little room for your apps).
* 2 CPUs or more.
* Full network connectivity between all machines in the cluster (public or private network is fine).
* Unique hostname, MAC address, and product_uuid for every node. See [here](#verify-mac-address) for more details.
* Certain ports are open on your machines. See [here](#check-required-ports) for more details.
* Swap disabled. You **MUST** disable swap in order for the kubelet to work properly.
    * For example, `sudo swapoff -a` will disable swapping temporarily. To make this change persistent across reboots, make sure swap is disabled in config files like `/etc/fstab`, `systemd.swap`, depending how it was configured on your system.
